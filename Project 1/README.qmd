## Question

Can we predict a player's performance/worth in an upcoming season based on their previous performance stats and other metrics?

Baseball has always been a game of numbers. However, with the rise of technology, the methods of how we obtain those numbersr has been evolving fast. Analyzing data and predicting a player's performances in the future is a crucial step for a team in their roster management. In this project, I will attempt to predict a given player's worth in an upcoming season given their past performances and age, among other factors.

## Data Dimensions

*Statcast* 45 columns x 2492 rows (players with 300+ plate appearances in any given season from 2015-2024 except 2020) + 142 rows (qualified hitters from shortened 2020 season)

*Baseball Reference* 34 columns x 1100 - 1300 rows x 10 years (2015-2024)

We will merge the Baseball Reference dataset onto the Statcast dataset, deleting any entries that don't appear in Statcast. We will only keep the WAR, Runs, OPS+, rOBA, and Rbat+ columns from Baseball Reference.
