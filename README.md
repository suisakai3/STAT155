## Question

Can we predict a playerâ€™s performance/worth in an upcoming season based
on their previous performance stats and other metrics?

### Project 1
Data Wrangling

Choose the question to consider for the entire project.
Find data for the project and clean the data to get it ready for modeling.
Simply run data_wrangling.py to clean the raw data. 

### Project 2
Exploratory Data Analysis

Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate data analysis in eda.qmd

### Project 3
Modeling

LSTM and Random Forest Models. project3.qmd contains all the code and analysis, modeling.py is all the code contained in project3.qmd

### Project 4
Monte Carlo Simulation

Data generation, model training, and analysis of each model (Random Forest, Linear and Ridge Regression).
project4_simulation_sakai_sui.qmd contains all the code and analysis of the Monte Carlo simulation.
